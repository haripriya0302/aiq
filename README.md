# Air Quality Index Prediction using Machine Learning in Google Colab

## Overview

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) based on air quality-related parameters and meteorological features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical records of air quality parameters such as particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and meteorological features like temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The dataset is obtained from [source link].

## Setup

To run this project in Google Colab:

1. Open Google Colab.
2. Upload the dataset file.
3. Execute the provided code cells in the notebook.

Ensure the required libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn are installed. If not, you can install them using:

```bash
!pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
